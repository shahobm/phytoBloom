# phytoBloom
A web app for students to learn algae bloom prediction models.

# About
An admin will use the predicitive algorithim with some preselected variables to solve the equation. Students may then test their understanding of the algorithim by inputting the correct light/depth/date variables given the scenario.

# ToDo
1. Connect light value to change the opacity of the back fill color of the tank.
