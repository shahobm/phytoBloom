# About
Current experment being built is experiment 1.
An admin will use the predicitive algorithim with some preselected variables to solve the equation. Students may then test their understanding of the algorithim by inputting the correct light/depth/date variables given the scenario.

# ToDo
1. Connect light value to change the opacity of the back fill color of the tank.
2. Connect the light slider to change the the time of day when the "show given variable" button is selected allow slider max to be the midpoint and the minimums to be on the ends?
3. allow the date slider to display the cooresponding date for the selected day whenever adjusted.
