							<p>The spring phytoplankton bloom is a rapid and remarkable increase in the concentration of phytoplankton that typically occurs in early spring. It is often observed in the North Atlantic, in sub-polar waters, and in temperate coastal marine waters. Understanding the timing of the spring bloom and the processes that generate this phenomenon was a major problem addressed in biological oceanography. The classic explanation for the spring bloom is Sverdrup’s (1953) critical depth concept. Despite later critiques of this concept, it remains an important theory in biological oceanography. And, because Sverdrup’s explanation integrates concepts from physical and biological oceanography, it is a great exam question in oceanography courses.</p>

							<p>One way to define the critical depth is the depth is the depth above which depth-integrated daily gross photosynthesis equals the depth-integrated respiration, where respiration includes biomass removal by phytoplankton respiration and by grazers. Sverdrup (1953) argued that when the critical depth becomes deeper than the depth of the surface mixed layer, the daily average rate of organic-matter production will exceed its rate of destruction and a phytoplankton bloom will occur. When the critical depth is shallower than the mixed-later depth, no bloom can occur. In spring, as light availability increases, the critical depth deepens. The timing of the spring bloom, therefore, depends upon light intensity, the rate of loss of phytoplankton (respiration), and the depth of the surface mixed layer.</p>

							<p>The following three experiments enable you to explore how light, mixing, and respiration interact to generate a spring phytoplankton bloom. In the first experiment, you can manipulate the intensity of sunlight, the respiration rate, and the mixed layer depth and identify conditions under which a phytoplankton bloom can occur. In the second experiment, light intensity is set by measurements of light intensity measured in Bellingham Bay, WA. You can manipulate the depth of mixing and respiration. The third experiment takes place in shallow water where water depth sets the mixed-layer depth. You can manipulate light and respiration to observe the conditions that lead to a phytoplankton bloom in shallow water.</p>

							<h1>About</h1>
							<div class="inner">

							<p>In the three experiments above Students examine different scenarios for which a bloom may occur.

								<br><br>

								Experiment 1 allows students to toggle average irradiance level the water layer will receive usually following the angle of the sun in relation to the waterways position. As well as the depth of the mixing layer and level of phytoplankton respiration. These inputs are processed by the mathematical model which describes Sverdrups theory and show when a bloom will occur. The relation between light and respiration is examined.

								<br><br>

								Experiment 2 allows toggling of just the respiration and mixing layer depth where irradiance is fixed but shows how irradiance levels will vary through January to July and how a critical depth level may vary through this time period.

								<br><br>

								Experiment 3 examines a scenario with a significantly shallow water level where the seafloor acts as a mixing layer depth for the system and allows irradiance and respiration levels to be changed.

							</p>

							<p>The Sverdrup critical-depth model gives evidence that yearly phytoplankton blooms occur as a result of light supply and the depth of vertical mixing. This results in a corresponding total population of zooplankton following the harvesting of suffiecient light energy and subsequent maintenance of that population. The combination of the critical depth model can be framed in a mathematical model for the initiation of algal blooms. Assuming that a given body of water has sufficient nutrient supply, the phytoplankton levels will follow the amount of irradiance a water layer receives following seasonal variations in light intensity.</p>

							<p>The Sverdrup critical depth model is not withouts its challenges. Recent examinations of the timing of spring blooms in the Pacific and Atlantic are indeed consistent with the critical depth model (Obata et al., 1996). However challenges to the underlying assumptions of the theory (Smetacek and Passow, 1990) have been raised. This has lead researchers to examine additional functions for spring bloom occurrences including iron limitations (Martin et a/., 1991). The model therefore does not provide a definite model for all water systems, it has been a useful tool to describe many seasonal blooms.</p>

							<p>The mathematical model that follows Sverdrups theory states that: del P/del t = D(del2P/delz2) + I*a*exp(-kz) - R, where P is the phytoplankton biomass, D is vertical diffusion (mixing), z is water depth, I is incoming solar radiation (a function of time), a is the fraction of incoming light that enters the water and leads to the production of phytoplankton, k is the light attenuation coefficient, and R is respiration (or the loss of P, constant with depth).
							Model domain: z = 0 to Zd. (Zd is the mixing depth, which varies with time).
							</p>

							<p>
							As the student solves the model, the program may tell the student whether a given variable is close to a correct solution, or if a solution is too high or low. It may also accept solutions within a certain range. This includes light intensity/angle, day of the year, and depth. But may also include O2 or CO2 levels and other variables. Colors of the tank may also change such that the depth slider represents the critical/mixing depth rather than the total water depth.</p>
